AI-Powered Drone for Human Interaction

This project explores the exciting world of human-drone interaction using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision techniques. Our drone leverages real-time detection and tracking of human body parts, faces, and hand gestures to achieve various functionalities.

Project Goals

Implement AI algorithms for body detection, body following, face detection, and hand gesture detection.
Enable the drone to autonomously follow a person based on their body location.
Allow the drone to recognize and potentially respond to specific hand gestures for drone control.
Develop a user-friendly system for monitoring and controlling the drone's operation.
Potential Applications

Enhanced Search and Rescue: Drones can autonomously search for missing persons with greater precision by relying on body detection.
Immersive Videography: Body following allows the drone to capture dynamic video footage of a subject on the move.
Intuitive Drone Control: Hand gestures offer a natural and potentially hands-free way to control the drone.
Human-Drone Collaboration: Collaborative tasks are possible when the drone can detect and respond to human presence and actions.
Accessibility and Assistance: Drones equipped with hand gesture detection can provide assistance to individuals with limited mobility.
Technical Considerations

Hardware:
Drone platform (e.g., quadcopter)
Camera with a high frame rate (for real-time processing)
Processing unit capable of running AI models (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano)
Communication module (e.g., Wi-Fi) for control and monitoring
Software:
Programming language (e.g., Python)
AI framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
Computer Vision libraries (e.g., OpenCV, MediaPipe)
Flight control software
Libraries for drone communication (specific to your drone model)
Datasets: Access to datasets for training AI models is essential. Consider creating your own or using publicly available datasets for human body parts, faces, and hand gestures.

Getting Started

Set up the Development Environment: Install necessary software (programming language, AI framework, CV libraries).
Gather Data: Collect image or video data containing human body parts, faces, and hand gestures for training AI models.
Train AI Models: Develop or train AI models for body detection, body tracking, face detection, and hand gesture detection.
Integrate with Drone Hardware: Connect your software to the drone's flight control system and camera.
Test and Refine: Thoroughly test the system in a safe environment and iterate to improve performance.
